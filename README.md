1. Number Guessing Game :
This simple console application challenges players to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. It provides feedback on each guess and tracks the number of attempts. After each round, players can choose to play again or exit. Great way to practice Java basics like loops, conditionals, and random number generation. Check it out and let me know what you think!

2. Calculator
A simple Java-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and supports for multiple calculations in a single session.

3. Temperature Converter Project
This Java-based Temperature Converter allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program takes user input for the temperature value and the desired target unit, then accurately performs the conversion using dedicated methods for each temperature scale. This project was developed as part of an internship with CodeVisionary, focusing on reinforcing Java fundamentals such as input handling, method implementation, and conditionals.
